// Strings are immutable

//Strings cannot be changed after they are created. 
// For example, you can't directly modify a character in the string, but you can create a new string

let name = 'John'; // Single quotes
let message = `Welcome, ${name}!`; // Backticks (template literals)
console.log(message);
